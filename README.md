# Noise Reduction using Adaptive Filters - MATLAB Implementation

In this project, we implement the LMS, VLMS, NLMS, and RLS algorithms using MATLAB. Subsequently, we test these algorithms for noise reduction in various scenarios and analyze the results. Finally, we record a sound with a microphone, add noise to it, and use these algorithms to remove the noise, comparing the results.

## Introduction

Noise reduction is a fundamental problem in signal processing, with applications ranging from audio enhancement to communication systems. Adaptive filters provide an effective means of reducing noise in signals by adaptively adjusting filter coefficients based on the input signal and desired response.

## Implemented Algorithms

- Least Mean Squares (LMS)
- Variable Step-size LMS (VLMS)
- Normalized LMS (NLMS)
- Recursive Least Squares (RLS)

## Implementation

We provide MATLAB implementations for each of the above algorithms. Each implementation includes a detailed explanation of the algorithm, parameter settings, and code structure.

## Testing Scenarios

We test the implemented algorithms for noise reduction in various scenarios, including:
- White noise reduction
- Colored noise reduction
- Speech signal enhancement

## Experimental Setup

1. **Data Generation**: Generate noisy signals for testing using MATLAB's built-in functions or recorded audio samples.
2. **Algorithm Implementation**: Implement LMS, VLMS, NLMS, and RLS algorithms.
3. **Parameter Tuning**: Tune algorithm parameters such as step size, filter length, and forgetting factor.
4. **Evaluation**: Evaluate algorithm performance using metrics such as signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and mean square error (MSE).
5. **Comparison**: Compare the performance of different algorithms in terms of noise reduction effectiveness and computational complexity.
